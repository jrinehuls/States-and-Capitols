# States-and-Capitols
A states and capitols quiz.
A 2D array is used to store states and their capitols ordered alphabetically by state.
A bubble sort (I know, horrible time complexity) is sued to reorder the array alphabetically by capitol.
A user is quizzed to test their knowledge of sataes and capitols and they are given a score at the end.
